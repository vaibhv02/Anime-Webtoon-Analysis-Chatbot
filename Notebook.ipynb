      "If you are keeping up with Wendy Lian Martin’s captivating webtoon, then you know that Castle Swimmer Season 2 has taken us deeper into mystery and intrigue. This gripping section delves into thefallout of the revelationin Chapter 82, where a conversation shows the depth of Siren’s curse and the apparent eternity tormenting him and his people. Castle Swimmer Chapter 83-89 raise the stakes, keeping secrets darker and more complex in character journeys than ever. Let’s get down to the exciting new chapters to experience them firsthand!Table of ContentsToggleCastle Swimmer Chapter 83 – 86: Strong-Willed SirenThe Mini-God’s RoleApologies And ConfessionsNew GoalCastle Swimmer Chapter 87-89: Kappa’s New ProphecyQueen NeeThe Castle from PastPersonal ReflectionCastle Swimmer Chapter 83 – 86: Strong-Willed SirenPrince SirenCastle Swimmer Chapter 83  begins with a shocking revelation. As prophesied, Siren was supposed to save his race by breaking curses, but it was discovered that he was cursed himself. The role of the savior, as foretold in the prophecy, became a fatal trap when it was revealed that fulfilling it another way would not bring redemption but doom for him.Thus, their conversation uncovers both being trapped in their predicament. The mysterious figure informs Siren that he can break free from his curse but still lose everyone. They will only have a chance to follow what has been stated.Siren mournfully acknowledges Kappa killing him as part of the prophecy. The burden of knowing that he is part of an ending foretold in the prophecy is too much for him to bear. Nevertheless, his resilience cuts through the darkness.He does not want to defy the prophecy out of obligation or duty but because he wants to live. This involves more than just traveling and seeing the world; instead, it encompasses visiting palaces, swimming freely across oceans, and making new acquaintances. By saying,“I deserve a chance to live. I am going to fight for it,”he refuses a fate determined by prophecies.The Mini-God’s RoleSirenChapter 84 begins with Siren hearing something informative and scary: a living mini-god must sustain a curse. Therefore, if the first mini-god who cursed them is no longer there, then its powers must have gone to another since they can share their powers.As he probes further into this matter, he discovers that another mini-god possesses power over the curse. The dialogue shifts to a sad note as the character, on the brink of transformation, imparts a grave warning:“Don’t trust prophecies. Don’t trust the words of gods. Don’t end up like we did.”On waking up, Siren discovers that he has been returned to where he was before being taken away. The shift from an eerie prophetic environment to this familiar ground is jarring as it intensifies disorientation and urgency.In the next scene, Pagoon and Pim begin to breathe again after realizing Siren is alive. He insists they stay away because he thinks it might be another illusion or trick. Nonetheless, Arp went towards them happily, relieving Siren a bit. This kind of confirmation helps him overcome his fears about the illusory nature of his true companions.The chapter ends with the group quickly leaving their dangerous location behind.Apologies And ConfessionsSiren, Pim, and Pagoon with ArpPim begins chapter 85 by profusely apologizing to Pagoon and Siren. She accepts her mistake of taking them all directly toward God’s Mouth instead of being more cautious, which could have killed all three of them.She is reassured by them, who tell her not to worry because they had been warned before leading her into danger.Later, Pim asks Siren how he is holding up. He tells her that he feels numb and has a headache, which are signs of emotional and physical stress. This conversation leads to Pim giving Siren a knife she discovered during their search. This knife brings a profoundly emotional moment, representing much about Siren’s past life.He reveals his mother’s scar on him as a painful memory. Even though filled with so much hate, he says that he still really misses his mom and tries to forget all those bitter memories completely.While reminiscing on what happened, Siren tells Pim she reminds him of his mother. He thought leaving the castle would help him let go of his old life and concentrate on saving other lives instead. Nonetheless, while they were in the trenches, some memories returned, indicating that the past would always haunt him one way or another.The chapter ends with Siren confiding in Pim about his escapades, which only opens a gateway for digging into his past life. This instance of being vulnerable and having trust builds up the plot as it allows readers to understand better Siren’s internal conflicts and how he relates with Pim.New GoalSiren, Pim, and Pagoon with ArpCastle Swimmer Chapter 86 begins with an astonished Pagoon, who has just learned of Siren’s past. He is deeply touched by his past involving the castle and the beacon and how he is determined to break the curse and free his people.Siren used this occasion to confess his humility and that his issues were nothing compared to Pim’s.In another scene, however, a sweet flashback shows a young Arp being chased by an eel. Kappa rescued Arp and took him in, promising him love and protection like one would give their child. This scene provides much-needed background information about the relationship between Arp and Kappa while adding emotional depth to what is happening presently.Once again, we are brought back into current events by looking at where Siren’s thoughts are taking him next. He must find a demi-god that will break the curse put upon him. It dawns on him that Kappa might know something since he knows a lot about prophecies. At the end of this chapter, Siren, with allies, sets out to find Kappa.Castle Swimmer Chapter 87-89: Kappa’s New ProphecyKappaCastle Swimmer Chapter 87 opens with Kappa waking up to a bad dream and discovering that Mono has been up all night. Mono’s and Kappa’s questions on what they would do after the Mini God is destroyed make it apparent that neither of them has a solid plan.Kappa’s answer reveals that he does not know what will happen after this adventure ends.His interaction with Mono further enhances his internal conflict. After this, Kappa starts getting pulled again. He realized that this connection was pointing toward another prophecy. This revelation adds an appealing twist to the storyline, insinuating that destiny might drive Kappa’s actions later.Queen NeeKappa and Queen NeeIn Castle Swimmer Chapter 88, Queen Nethimir tells Kappa to return to the crab. He is unwillingly drawn towards the nearest prophecy, creating a central conflict in the chapter as his journey is not self-directed but driven by powers beyond him. Mucku asks if he can use his witch endurance to withstand this, butKappa admits this is not an option, revealing his helplessness and sadness.As he follows it, Kappa’s path leads him to an enigmatic castle from his past. Though the castle appears empty for many years, he is fearful because this place does not suit any prophecy. Sensing his distress, the Evil Queen questions him about its history. After getting no response, she decides they should leave.However, as they prepare to leave, Mono spots what seems to be a person hiding behind one of the trees and uses her magic power to capture this figure, revealing Queen Nee.The Castle from PastKappaCastle Swimmer Chapter 89 starts with Queen Nee’s happiness at seeing Kappa again. He has visibly impressed her with his maturity, and she hopes Krilli will feel the same way when she sees him again. Heasks them why they are outside their usual Blue Hills domain, discussing their appearance today withQueen Nee and Krilli. An incident at Castle Colony triggered their departure recently. The absence of the beacon resulted in a destruction frenzy among them and the castles’ demolition.Queen Krilli was surprised to learn that the people Kappa had met recently were “evil witches from the dark seas,” as described by Queen Nethimir. On the other hand, he replies that they are his friends who are helping him become an evil witch.While they talk further, he asks why they moved to Purple Peaks. In response, Queen Nee explains that there were so many abandoned castles here, which made it perfect for building a new one.Castle Swimmer Chapter 89 takes a dramatic turn when Kappa volunteers to help them fulfill their prophecy, only for Queen Nee to say he is a special guest with no assigned tasks. Queen Nethimir interrupts them with urgent matters that require their attention, creating a playful yet tense conversation among them all.Personal ReflectionCastle Swimmer Chapter 83-89 continue to captivate with their intricate storytelling and emotional depth. The exploration of Siren’s curse and the unfolding prophecy adds complexity to the narrative. The portrayal of the Kappa’s dilemma and the fleeting moments of relief are particularly striking.As we wrap up this review ofCastle SwimmerChapter 83 to 89, it’s clear that the story is reaching new heights of intensity and intrigue.
